# SmartVan Monitor: Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: MVP (Months 1-3)
Focus on core functionality to detect basic theft patterns with minimal hardware requirements.

### Hardware MVP
- **2 Essential Cameras**:
  - Rear inventory camera (wide-angle, fixed position)
  - Side wall camera behind driver's seat
- **Computing Unit**: Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) with SSD storage
- **Basic Power Solution**: Vehicle power adapter with simple battery backup
- **Connectivity**: Basic WiFi connectivity for depot/office synchronization
- **Installation Kit**: Mounting brackets, cables, basic enclosure

### Software MVP
- **Basic Detection**:
  - Inventory access detection (when boxes/items are accessed)
  - Basic temporal logging (timestamps of all access events)
- **Simple Event Categorization**:
  - High-frequency access alerts
  - After-hours inventory access
- **Offline Storage**:
  - Local database of events
  - Video clip storage of flagged events only (to conserve space)
- **Manual Synchronization**:
  - End-of-day upload when connected to depot WiFi
  - Basic integration with existing backend via simple API

### Key MVP Metrics
- Detection of inventory access: 90% accuracy
- False positive rate: <15%
- Storage capacity: 3-5 days of operation
- Initial setup time: <2 hours per van

## Phase 2: Enhanced System (Months 4-6)
Improve detection accuracy and add more sophisticated behavioral analysis.

### Hardware Optimization
- **Same Core Hardware**:
  - Continue using the established camera system
  - Maintain Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) computing unit

  - GPS module for location correlation

### Software Enhancements
- **Advanced Detection**:
  - Box opening/product removal detection
  - Pattern recognition for concealment behaviors
  - Staff identification
- **Transaction Correlation**:
  - Match inventory access events with POS transactions
  - Flag discrepancies between inventory movement and sales
- **Automatic Synchronization**:
  - Scheduled uploads when connectivity available
  - Intelligent bandwidth management
  - Prioritized event uploading
- **Alert System**:
  - Real-time alerts for critical events when online
  - Severity classification

### Phase 2 Metrics
- Detection accuracy: >95% for inventory access
- Item removal detection: 80% accuracy
- False positive rate: <5%
- Automatic sync success rate: >90%

## Phase 3: Enterprise Solution (Months 7-12)
